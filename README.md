This is a quick attempt at a beeswarm plot with variable radius circles.  The plot is
based on [a New York Times visualisation](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/02/us/coronavirus-social-distancing.html). The data is borrowed from that page.

The layout algorithm is a modified version of [accurate-beeswarm-plot](https://github.com/jtrim-ons/accurate-beeswarm-plot).
